# Git Ignore and README Demonstration

## Description
This project demonstrates the use of `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files from version control and the creation of a structured `README.md` file to document a repository.

## Installation Steps
1. Create a `.gitignore` file to specify ignored files and directories.
2. Add patterns like `*.log`, `node_modules/`, and `*.env` to exclude unnecessary files.
3. Create a `README.md` file and include essential project information.
4. Commit and push the changes to the repository.

## Usage
- The `.gitignore` file ensures that temporary and sensitive files are not tracked by Git.
- The `README.md` file provides essential details about the repository.
